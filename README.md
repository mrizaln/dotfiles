# custom-desktop

Config files and scripts of my custom desktop environment (on Debian based system) using [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) as window manager, [sxhkd](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd) as hotkey daemon, [polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) as panel, and [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) as application launcher.

This repo was inspired by [this](https://github.com/christitustech/debian-titus).
